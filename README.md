This is my first personal project. 
TaskTroove is made as a bridge between local labour seekers and labour looking for work. 
This project is also highlighted in my resume as this is my first experience at building something that substantial.

So far, only the user part of the front end is done. the worker interface is yet to be made. The Log in interface also doesn't really take in and verify the data. backend is pretty much non existent. just the skeliton of the project is present as of now.
